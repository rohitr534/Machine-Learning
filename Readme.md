## üéØ Objective

- To build and refine machine learning models for real-world datasets.  
- To explore different modeling approaches: regression, regularization (Ridge, Lasso), simulation, feature selection, etc.  
- To enhance understanding of statistical phenomena (e.g. collider bias) and data processing techniques (feature engineering, dimensionality reduction).
